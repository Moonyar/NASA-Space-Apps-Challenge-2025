Tasks to do
- [X] Get Data in Folder
- [X] get website working
- [X] Take a look into submission details
- [X] Design Website
- [X] which dataset page + backend
- [X] which model page + backend
- [X] page for each model's hyperparam tuning + pick your columns from data (pick regressors and output column) + standardize/normalize/scalar + categorical or numerical + want todo ridge/lasso + backend
- [X] test train split page + backend
- [X] If TTS -> show output metrics -> ask if okay -> if yes, train model on whole data; if no -> continue editing the model parameters
- [X] upload/input data to be predicted on
- [X] show results with metrics -> abililty to download the csv
- [X] Add helps + descriptions for everything 
- [ ] make the project look nicer
- [ ] Fix the column selection to be better -> maybe description of columns?
- [ ] Fix adaboost algorithm selection
- [ ] select all button -> the selected y should not come up in the feature list on the right -> select all that is visible button
- [ ] fix the blurry thing on hyper tuning page
- [ ] look into regularization in NN and ridge/lasso
- [ ] in the fs section add a hint: use only if NN or log reg because other models really don't do better with it.
- [ ] look into which columns to choose for the demo
- [ ] finish submission

Nice to have
- [ ] give freedom to add columns by feature engineering
- [ ] improve the helps in PARAM SCHEMAS
